<h2>why not simply re-do the lottery?</h2>

<div id="explanation">
<h3>It seems fair...a simple example</h3>
<p>4 places, 1 group of 4, + 4 solo guests
</p>

<h3>But often, it will fail...</h3>
<p>If you have 5 places, and 1 more solo guest.
In 4 cases out of 5, you will have a 33% chance that you must redo the selection.
In 1 case out of 5, the group of 4 will be included.
