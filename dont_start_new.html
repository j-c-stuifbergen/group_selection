<h2>why not simply re-do the lottery?</h2>

<div id="explanation">

<h3>it doesn't work</h3>
<p>Example: you have 4 places, 4 solo guests and 1 team of 3.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that you will draw 4 soloists is:
<br>4/5 x 3/4 x 2/3 x 1/2 = 1/5
<li>1/5 is the probability that you immediately draw the team.
<li>And the probability that the team is drawn second, is
<br> 4/5 x 1/4 = 1/5 .
</ul>
<br> So the team has a chance of 2/5 to be selected.
1 of the soloists will be added, so this increases their chances by 1/4 x 2/5 = 1/10. 
<br>So far, the soloists have a chance of 1/5 + 1/10 = 30%.
The team has a chance of 2/5 = 40%
<br>In the remaing cases, the draw is invalid. </p>
</div>
