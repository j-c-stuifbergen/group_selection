Things left to do....
=====================
- decide wheter selectFirstCombination is needed in selectBestCombinations

- decide which value this.p should obtain after selectFirstCombination():
	[] or [1] or the best Least Squares value
 
- possibility to select combinations by hand?

- make improveWeights more efficient, for exampel:
  - when the derivatives are known, find the direction of maximum descent?
  - for each weight, find the value that minimizes the distance
