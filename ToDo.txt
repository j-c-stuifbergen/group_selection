Things left to do....
=====================

- interface: web-form for input of groups
(text field, + and - buttons)

- display the probabilities! (+ calculation?)

- possibility to select combinations by hand?

- improve lay-out: integrate deviations in the table

- in selectBestCombinations:
  only add a vector if the inner product is more than ....
  (otherwise, the matrix becomes nearly singular)
